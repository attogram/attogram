Attogram Framework
==================

The Attogram Framework gives developers a jumpstart to quickly create web sites. Attogram uses PHP with Apache2. It includes URL routing, an IP-protected backend, a user system, an integrated SQLite database with web administration, a Markdown parser,
jQuery and Bootstrap.

After that, Attogram tries to stay out of your way while you do your thing!
